# Resource Payload Placement in Malware Development

Welcome to the Resource Payload Placement in Malware Development repository. This project delves into the techniques and strategies used to embed malicious payloads within legitimate resources to avoid detection and achieve effective delivery.

## Overview

Resource payload placement focuses on hiding and deploying malicious payloads within various legitimate resources, such as:

- **Images**: Embedding payloads within image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- **Configuration Files**: Concealing payloads in configuration or data files.
- **Executable Binaries**: Inserting payloads into the resources of executable files.

This repository provides insights into these methods, offering educational content and examples to better understand how payloads can be effectively hidden and executed.
